# Health-Spending-and-Life-Expectancy
Performing an exploratory data analysis usin an example dataset on Seaborn online repository


## Introduction

Based on matplotlib, Seaborn is a Python data structure library for data visualizationÂ that works well with pandas. The main component of Seaborn that aids in data exploration and understanding is visualization.
To illustrate Seaborn and its powerful plotting capabilities,it is helpful to have example datasets readily available for plotting.For this, Seaborn provides a simple-to-use interface for loading datasets into Pandas dataframes.

A crucial factor in determining a country's health is its life expectancy. The datasets include information on life expectancy for the population from 1970 and 2000,and also healthcare expenditure for the corresponding country.


### Objective

The goal is to perform an exploratory data analysis, by answering the following questions.

1. What changes have occurred in healthcare spending over time?

2. How has life expectancy changed over time?

3. Do health spending and life expectancies have any correlation?

4. What were the average, lowest, and maximum life expectancies by country?



### Findings
1. There is an increase in spending over the years. 
2. There has been increase in life expectancy over the years.
3. There is a moderate correllation between the two variables(Spending_Usd and Life_Expectancy), where r = 0.58
4. Japan had the highest maximum life expectancy at 84.7 years old, while the USA had the lowest maximum life expectancy at 78.9 years old.
